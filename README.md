# projectSiriusA
A personal website to document my learning experience with regards to frontend development

## Plan:
1. A navbar on top (logo on the top left, a write new blog feature in the middle and a contact button plus search bar on the top right)
2. A side panel on the left to browse older blog posts
3. A side panel on the right which will be left empty for now but can be utilised for other features in the future.
4. A main panel in the middle to showcase all the blog posts.

## Behaviour:
1. As we scroll down the middle, it will load five blog posts each time the window reaches the bottom of the screen.
2. If new blog posts are written while we are browsing, a "See New Post" button will be shown on the top of the screen

## Planned Technology Stack:
1. HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
2. Vue.js
3. Python/Flask (marshamllow for input sanitation, swagger for documentation, SQLAlchemy for ORM and flask-restx for tying the three together)
4. PostgreSQL (might switch this out to a lighter db such as SQLite)
